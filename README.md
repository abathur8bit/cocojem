# CocoJEM

**CocoJEM** is a Color Computer emulator with the goal of making it easy to run and debug on the Color Computer 2 and 3 using the 6309 and 6809 CPU's.

# Features
I'm looking to create a new emulator that is easy to use, easy to maintain, is cross platform, and easy to extend. 

- Written in Java Swing. Not only does it makes cross platform easy, but you can make it look like the UI look native.
- Built in debugger that lets you load symbol tables, allowing you to step through your source code, instead of disassembly.
- Debugger lets you view registers and memory dumps.
- Memory dumps can show the memory as bytes or shows you the graphical contents. For example, you can see the 32x16 text buffer contents.
